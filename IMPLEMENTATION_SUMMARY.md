## Implementation Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

All services in the LeadLink platform follow a strict multi-tenant isolation pattern, ensuring data security and privacy between different tenants. Key implementation patterns include:

1. **Tenant Context Management**:
   - Services maintain current tenant context
   - All methods accept optional tenant ID override
   - Proper error handling for missing tenant context

2. **Collection Path Structure**:
   - Hierarchical collection paths: `tenants/{tenantId}/{collection}`
   - Consistent path generation across services

3. **Tenant Isolation Testing**:
   - Each service includes a `test{Service}Isolation` method
   - Verifies that data created in one tenant cannot be accessed from another

4. **Optional Tenant Override**:
   - All service methods accept an optional tenant ID parameter
   - Default to current tenant context when not provided

5. **Cache Isolation**:
   - Tenant-specific cache keys
   - Cache clearing by tenant ID
   - Prevents cross-tenant data leakage via cache

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline has been implemented to automate the building, testing, and deployment processes for the LeadLink application. The pipeline includes:

1. **Automated Quality Gates**: Linting, type checking, and code formatting
2. **Security Testing**: Security audits and Firebase security rules validation
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, visual, and performance tests
4. **Multi-Tenant Validation**: Automated tests to verify tenant isolation
5. **Deployment Automation**: Streamlined deployment to staging and production environments
6. **Notification System**: Automated alerts about deployment status

This pipeline ensures consistent, reliable, and secure deployments while maintaining high code quality standards. The full CI/CD pipeline documentation is available at [docs/infrastructure/CI_CD_PIPELINE.md](docs/infrastructure/CI_CD_PIPELINE.md).
