## Project Setup

### Firebase Project Configuration

The application uses a Firebase project with the following services enabled:

- Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Storage
- Cloud Functions
- Hosting

### Environment Configuration

Firebase configuration is stored in environment variables and loaded via the `EnvironmentConfigService`. Never commit Firebase API keys directly to the repository.

```typescript
// Example .env file structure
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Initialization

Firebase is initialized once in the application through the `FirebaseService`:

```typescript
// src/lib/services/FirebaseService.ts
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.FIREBASE_APP_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

## Authentication

### Authentication Methods

The following authentication methods are implemented:

- Email/password
- Google
- GitHub
- Phone number (SMS)
- Anonymous

### User Management

User profiles are stored in Firestore with the corresponding Firebase Auth UID as the document ID. The `AuthenticationService` provides methods for:

- User registration
- Login/logout
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Account linking
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management

### Role-Based Access Control

Access control is implemented using custom claims in Firebase Auth tokens and enforced through:

1. Frontend route guards
2. Backend security rules
3. Middleware for API requests

## Firestore Database

### Data Structure

Data is organized in collections with the following main entities:

- users
- tenants
- leads
- customers
- tasks
- notifications
- activities
- documents

### Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenant isolation is implemented using a combination of:

1. Collection-level separation (each tenant has separate collections)
2. Document-level tenant ID fields
3. Security rules that enforce tenant isolation

### Query Patterns

Common query patterns are implemented in the various service classes:

- `BasicCrudService` - Base class with common CRUD operations
- `LeadService` - Lead management specific operations
- `CustomerService` - Customer management operations
- `TaskService` - Task management operations

### Real-time Updates

Real-time listeners using the `onSnapshot` method are implemented for:

- User presence
- Task updates
- Notifications
- Collaborative features

## Storage

### File Organization

Files are organized in the following structure:

- /{tenantId}/users/{userId}/profile - User profile pictures
- /{tenantId}/leads/{leadId}/attachments - Lead attachments
- /{tenantId}/customers/{customerId}/attachments - Customer attachments
- /{tenantId}/documents - Generated documents

### Upload Process

File uploads are handled by the `StorageService` which:

1. Validates file types and sizes
2. Generates secure URLs
3. Manages metadata
4. Handles access control

### Download Process

File downloads are secured through:

1. Short-lived signed URLs
2. Role-based access controls
3. Rate limiting for downloads

## Cloud Functions

### Function Types

Cloud Functions are used for:

- Data triggers (onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete)
- HTTP endpoints for API extension
- Authentication triggers
- Scheduled tasks
- Pub/Sub event handling

### Implementation Patterns

Functions follow these patterns:

- Modular organization by domain
- Dependency injection for testability
- Error handling with consistent formats
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Rules

### Firestore Rules

Firestore security rules implement:

- Multi-tenant isolation
- Role-based access control
- Data validation
- Rate limiting
- Field-level security

### Storage Rules

Storage rules implement:

- Size limits
- File type validation
- Ownership verification
- Path validation

## Performance Monitoring

### Monitoring Setup

Performance is monitored using:

- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Custom performance traces for key operations
- Logging of performance metrics

### Optimization Techniques

The implementation uses these optimization techniques:

- Query caching
- Indexing for common queries
- Denormalization of frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large datasets
- Lazy loading of non-critical data

## Testing

### Testing Framework

Testing uses:

- Jest for unit tests
- Firebase emulators for integration tests
- Simulated E2E tests
- Custom test runners

### Authentication Testing

Auth testing includes:

- Mock authentication service
- Test user accounts
- Verification of permissions

### Firestore Testing

Firestore testing includes:

- CRUD operations testing
- Query testing
- Security rules testing

### Test Automation

Tests are automated via:

- GitHub Actions
- Scheduled test runs
- Test reporting

## Deployment

### Deployment Environments

Three deployment environments are supported:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

### Deployment Process

The deployment process includes:

1. Testing
2. Building
3. Deploying to Firebase Hosting
4. Deploying Firebase Function changes
5. Updating security rules

### Monitoring Deployments

Deployments are monitored using:

- Health checks
- Deployment logs
- Rollback procedures

## Troubleshooting

Documentation for resolving common issues:

1. Authentication errors
2. Firestore permission issues
3. Storage access problems
4. Function deployment failures
