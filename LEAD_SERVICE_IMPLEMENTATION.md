# Lead Service Implementation with Multi-Tenant Isolation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the LeadService with multi-tenant isolation (DATA-4). The service provides comprehensive lead management functionality while ensuring proper data isolation between tenants.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Lead Management
- **Lead CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete lead records
- **Status Management**: Track and update lead status through the sales pipeline
- **Lead Assignment**: Assign leads to users and track ownership
- **Tag Support**: Add and manage tags for lead categorization
- **Value Tracking**: Record and update lead potential value

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Tenant Context Management**: Set and retrieve the current tenant context for operations
- **Tenant-Specific Collection Access**: Methods to access tenant-isolated lead collections
- **Isolation Testing**: Built-in functionality to verify data isolation between tenants

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Company-Specific Queries**: Get leads for specific companies
- **Status Filtering**: Filter leads by status
- **User Assignment Filtering**: Get leads assigned to specific users
- **Text Search**: Basic search functionality across lead data
- **Recent Leads**: Get recently updated leads for quick access

## Technical Implementation

### Tenant Context
- Implemented tenant context management with:
  - Constructor parameter for initial tenant ID
  - Set/get methods for tenant context
  - Error handling for missing tenant context
  - Tenant ID parameter in all API methods

### Data Isolation Approach
- **Hierarchical Collections**: Lead data is stored in tenant-specific subcollections (`tenants/{tenantId}/leads`)
- **Tenant ID Required**: All operations require a tenant ID either from context or as a parameter
- **Collection References**: Dynamic generation of collection references based on current tenant

### Real-time Capabilities
- **Live Data Updates**: Subscribe to real-time changes to leads
- **Company-Specific Subscriptions**: Filter real-time updates by company

## Security Considerations

- **Cross-Tenant Prevention**: Methods to prevent data leakage between tenants
- **Tenant Isolation Testing**: Built-in method to test tenant isolation
- **User Tracking**: Record which user performs which operations

## Usage Examples

### Setting Tenant Context
```typescript
// Set the tenant context for subsequent operations
const leadService = new LeadService();
leadService.setTenantContext('tenant-123');

// Or initialize with a tenant ID
const leadService = new LeadService('tenant-123');
```

### Basic CRUD Operations
```typescript
// Create a new lead
const newLead = await leadService.createLead({
  companyId: 'company-456',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  status: LeadStatus.NEW,
  source: LeadSource.WEBSITE
}, 'user-789');

// Get a lead
const lead = await leadService.getLead('lead-123');

// Update a lead
await leadService.updateLead('lead-123', {
  status: LeadStatus.QUALIFIED
}, 'user-789');

// Delete a lead
await leadService.deleteLead('lead-123');
```

### Filtering and Searching
```typescript
// Get leads for a specific company
const companyLeads = await leadService.getLeadsByCompany('company-456');

// Get leads with a specific status
const newLeads = await leadService.getLeadsByStatus(LeadStatus.NEW);

// Get leads assigned to a user
const assignedLeads = await leadService.getLeadsByAssignee('user-789');

// Search leads
const searchResults = await leadService.searchLeads('acme', 'company-456');
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
// Subscribe to leads for a company
const unsubscribe = leadService.subscribeToCompanyLeads('company-456', (leads) => {
  console.log('Updated leads:', leads);
});

// Later, unsubscribe to stop listening
unsubscribe();
```

### Multi-tenant Testing
```typescript
// Test isolation between two tenants
const result = await leadService.testLeadIsolation('tenant-1', 'tenant-2');
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Tenant isolation working properly');
} else {
  console.error('Tenant isolation issue:', result.message);
}
```

## Testing

The service includes the `testLeadIsolation` method that verifies data isolation between tenants by:
1. Creating test data in one tenant
2. Attempting to access it from another tenant
3. Verifying that the data is not accessible across tenant boundaries
4. Cleaning up the test data

## Integration with Other Services

The Lead service can integrate with:
- **TenantService**: For tenant context management
- **LeadAssignmentService**: For automatic lead assignment
- **LeadScoringService**: For lead qualification and scoring
- **CustomerService**: For converting leads to customers
- **ActivityService**: For tracking interactions with leads

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the lead management system:
- Enhanced lead scoring with machine learning
- More sophisticated search capabilities
- Lead deduplication functionality
- Lead import/export tools
- Advanced lead analytics and reporting
- Lead workflow automation
- Integration with marketing automation platforms
