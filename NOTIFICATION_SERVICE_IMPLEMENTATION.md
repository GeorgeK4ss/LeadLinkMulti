# Notification Service Implementation with Multi-Tenant Isolation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the NotificationService with multi-tenant isolation (DATA-7). The service provides a comprehensive notification system for both users and system events while ensuring proper data isolation between tenants.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Notification Management
- **Multiple Notification Types**: Enum-based classification of different notification types
- **Priority Levels**: Support for varying urgency levels (low, medium, high, urgent)
- **Recipient Management**: Add/remove recipients from notifications
- **Read Status Tracking**: Track which users have read notifications
- **Dismissal Handling**: Allow users to dismiss notifications
- **Expiration Management**: Automatic expiration of notifications after a specified period

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Tenant Context Management**: Set and retrieve the current tenant context for operations
- **Tenant-Specific Collection Access**: Methods to access tenant-isolated notification collections
- **Isolation Testing**: Built-in functionality to verify data isolation between tenants

### 3. Real-time Capabilities
- **Live Notification Updates**: Subscribe to real-time notification streams
- **User-Specific Notifications**: Filter notifications relevant to specific users
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Order notifications by creation date and filter by status

## Technical Implementation

### Notification Types
Implemented a comprehensive enum of notification types covering various entity operations:
- Lead-related notifications (assigned, status changed)
- Customer-related notifications (assigned)
- Task-related notifications (assigned, due soon, overdue)
- User interaction notifications (mentions, comments, messages)
- System notifications (reports, campaigns, team invites)
- Custom notification type for extensibility

### Tenant Context
- Implemented tenant context management with:
  - Constructor parameter for initial tenant ID
  - Set/get methods for tenant context
  - Error handling for missing tenant context
  - Tenant ID parameter in all API methods as an override option

### Data Isolation Approach
- **Hierarchical Collections**: Notification data is stored in tenant-specific subcollections (`tenants/{tenantId}/notifications`)
- **Collection References**: Dynamic generation of collection references based on current tenant
- **Tenant ID Validation**: All operations validate the tenant context or parameter

### Notification Workflow
- **Creation**: Create notifications with customizable fields and metadata
- **Delivery**: Manage recipients and ensure proper tenant-specific delivery
- **Status Management**: Track read/unread and dismissed status per user
- **Cleanup**: Automatic or manual removal of expired notifications

## Security Considerations

- **Cross-Tenant Prevention**: Methods to prevent data leakage between tenants
- **Tenant Isolation Testing**: Built-in method to test tenant isolation
- **User Tracking**: Record which users read or dismiss notifications
- **Expiration Enforcement**: Automatically expire notifications to prevent information overload

## Usage Examples

### Setting Tenant Context
```typescript
// Set the tenant context for subsequent operations
const notificationService = new NotificationService();
notificationService.setTenantContext('tenant-123');

// Or initialize with a tenant ID
const notificationService = new NotificationService('tenant-123');
```

### Creating Notifications
```typescript
// Create a notification for multiple recipients
await notificationService.createNotification(
  NotificationType.LEAD_ASSIGNED,
  'New Lead Assigned',
  'A new lead has been assigned to you',
  ['user-123', 'user-456'],
  {
    priority: NotificationPriority.HIGH,
    link: '/leads/lead-789',
    metadata: {
      leadId: 'lead-789',
      leadName: 'John Doe',
      assignedBy: 'admin-user'
    },
    createdBy: 'system'
  }
);
```

### Retrieving Notifications
```typescript
// Get all unread notifications for a user
const unreadNotifications = await notificationService.getUnreadNotifications('user-123');

// Get all notifications for a user (read and unread, but not dismissed)
const allNotifications = await notificationService.getUserNotifications('user-123', 50);
```

### Managing Notification Status
```typescript
// Mark a notification as read
await notificationService.markAsRead('notification-123', 'user-123');

// Mark multiple notifications as read
await notificationService.markMultipleAsRead(['notification-123', 'notification-456'], 'user-123');

// Mark all notifications as read
await notificationService.markAllAsRead('user-123');

// Dismiss a notification
await notificationService.dismissNotification('notification-123', 'user-123');
```

### Real-time Notifications
```typescript
// Subscribe to notifications for a user
const unsubscribe = notificationService.subscribeToUserNotifications(
  'user-123',
  (notifications) => {
    console.log('Updated notifications:', notifications);
    // Update UI with new notifications
  }
);

// Later, unsubscribe when no longer needed
unsubscribe();
```

### Managing Recipients
```typescript
// Add recipients to an existing notification
await notificationService.addRecipients(
  'notification-123',
  ['user-789', 'user-012'],
  'admin-user'
);

// Remove recipients from a notification
await notificationService.removeRecipients(
  'notification-123',
  ['user-789'],
  'admin-user'
);
```

### Maintenance Operations
```typescript
// Delete expired notifications
const deletedCount = await notificationService.deleteExpiredNotifications();
console.log(`Deleted ${deletedCount} expired notifications`);

// Delete a specific notification
await notificationService.deleteNotification('notification-123');
```

## Testing

The service includes the `testNotificationIsolation` method that verifies data isolation between tenants by:
1. Creating a test notification in one tenant
2. Attempting to access it from another tenant
3. Verifying that the notification is not accessible across tenant boundaries
4. Cleaning up the test data

## Integration with Other Services

The NotificationService integrates with:
- **TenantService**: For tenant context management
- **ActivityService**: For creating notifications based on activities
- **UserService**: For user-related notifications
- **LeadService**: For lead assignment and status change notifications
- **CustomerService**: For customer assignment notifications
- **TaskService**: For task-related notifications

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the notification system:
- Push notification integration for mobile and web clients
- Email delivery integration for important notifications
- Notification templates with dynamic content
- User notification preferences and customization
- Notification grouping and categorization
- Advanced filtering and searching of notifications
- Notification analytics and insights
- Batch notification creation for system events
